- Well-formatted questions with clear intent

**Sample Excellence:**
```
Report: "Q4: OKR Beep QR GMV MoM Growth [SGD]"
Generated Question: "What is the month-over-month growth trend of our Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)..."
Score: 5/5 - Perfect semantic alignment
```

#### 2. Deconstruction Accuracy Score: 2.75/5 ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

**Critical Gap Identified:**
- Inconsistent mapping between SQL query components and described metrics/filters
- Complex aggregations not always properly captured in Primary Metrics
- WHERE clause conditions not consistently reflected in Key Filters

**Improvement Areas:**
- Enhanced SQL parsing for aggregation functions
- Better extraction of filter conditions from WHERE clauses
- More precise mapping of GROUP BY logic to metrics descriptions

#### 3. Blueprint Potential Score: 4.08/5 ‚úÖ **STRONG PERFORMANCE**

**Strengths:**
- High business relevance with revenue, customer, and performance focus
- Well-structured components suitable for NL-to-SQL training
- Clear, specific questions that demonstrate valuable patterns

**Value Indicators:**
- 87% of reports contain business-relevant terminology
- Questions average 65+ characters, indicating sufficient specificity
- Strong representation of common business analytics patterns

## Top Performing Examples

### Excellence Tier (Score: 5.0)

1. **"Q4: OKR Beep QR GMV MoM Growth [SGD]"**
   - **Question:** "What is the month-over-month growth trend of our Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)..."
   - **Excellence:** Perfect semantic clarity, accurate SQL deconstruction, high blueprint value

2. **"Deals Club New Order GMV MoM by Channel"**
   - **Question:** "What is the month-over-month performance of our acquisition channels..."
   - **Excellence:** Comprehensive business context with precise technical mapping

## Improvement Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 2-4 weeks)

1. **Enhanced SQL Parser Development**
   - Implement more sophisticated aggregation function detection
   - Improve WHERE clause parsing for filter extraction
   - Add support for complex JOIN conditions in metrics description

2. **Quality Threshold Implementation**
   - Focus regeneration efforts on the 23 reports scoring below 3.0
   - Prioritize the 1,032 reports in the 3.0-4.0 range for targeted improvements

3. **Automated Quality Gates**
   - Implement minimum score thresholds (3.5+ overall) for AI system ingestion
   - Create feedback loops for continuous improvement

### Strategic Improvements (1-3 months)

1. **SQL Context Enhancement**
   - Develop table schema awareness for better metric naming
   - Implement business glossary integration for consistent terminology
   - Add data lineage understanding for complex queries

2. **Training Data Optimization**
   - Use the 495 high-quality reports (‚â•4.0) as immediate training data
   - Implement progressive quality improvement for medium-scoring reports
   - Create specialized improvement pipelines for different SQL complexity levels

## Business Impact Assessment

### Current State Value
- **Immediately Usable:** 495 reports (31.9%) ready for AI training
- **Near-Term Potential:** 1,527 reports (98.5%) with scores ‚â•3.0 show strong foundation
- **Technical Debt:** Only 23 reports require complete regeneration

### ROI Projection
- **High-Quality Baseline:** 31.9% AI-ready provides solid foundation for initial system deployment
- **Improvement Efficiency:** 66.6% of reports in "fair" category require only moderate enhancement
- **Risk Mitigation:** Low percentage (1.5%) of poor-quality reports minimizes rework costs

## Next Steps & Action Plan
