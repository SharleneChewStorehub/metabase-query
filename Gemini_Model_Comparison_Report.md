## Conclusion

**For your business context generation use case, I recommend starting with Gemini 2.5 Pro** due to its superior reasoning capabilities and instruction following performance. The higher cost is justified by the complex nature of SQL-to-business-context translation and the need for high accuracy.

**Consider Gemini 2.5 Flash for cost-optimized scaling** once you've established quality baselines and want to process larger volumes efficiently.

The key is to prioritize accuracy first (Pro), then optimize for cost and speed (Flash) as you scale the system.
