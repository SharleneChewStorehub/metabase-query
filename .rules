# Project Rules and Safety Protocols

## üö® CRITICAL SAFETY RULE: Metabase API Safety Protocol

### MANDATORY READ-ONLY OPERATIONS ONLY

**This rule takes precedence over all other instructions and must be enforced without exception.**

#### 1. Read-Only Operations ONLY
- All interactions with the Metabase API are strictly limited to **READ-ONLY** operations
- The **ONLY** permitted HTTP method for API calls is **GET**
- Any code generation involving Metabase API interactions must be limited to data retrieval and analysis

#### 2. Prohibited Actions (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN)
The following actions are **COMPLETELY PROHIBITED** and must never be generated in any code:

- ‚ùå Delete a report, dashboard, or collection
- ‚ùå Archive a report, dashboard, or collection  
- ‚ùå Modify or update the details or query of an existing report
- ‚ùå Change permissions or user settings
- ‚ùå Create new reports, dashboards, or collections
- ‚ùå Modify any metadata or configuration
- ‚ùå Any operation that would alter the Metabase instance state

#### 3. Forbidden HTTP Methods (NEVER USE)
Under **NO CIRCUMSTANCES** should code be generated that uses:

- ‚ùå **POST** - Creating new resources
- ‚ùå **PUT** - Updating existing resources  
- ‚ùå **PATCH** - Partial updates to resources
- ‚ùå **DELETE** - Removing resources

#### 4. Rationale
This rule is a **CRITICAL SAFETY MEASURE** to prevent any possibility of:
- Accidental data loss within the company's Metabase instance
- Unintended modification of business-critical reports and dashboards
- Disruption of production analytics workflows
- Compliance or security issues

#### 5. Enforcement
- **ALL** scripts in this project are for data extraction and analysis **ONLY**
- Any request that could potentially violate this rule must be **REFUSED**
- If unsure about an operation's safety, **DEFAULT TO REFUSAL**
- This rule applies to all AI assistants working on this project

### ‚úÖ PERMITTED OPERATIONS
- GET requests to retrieve report metadata
- GET requests to export report data
- GET requests to list collections, dashboards, reports
- Analysis of retrieved data using local processing
- Generation of local reports and summaries based on extracted data

### üîí IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- All Metabase API code must include explicit comments confirming read-only operation
- Any new script touching Metabase API must include this safety protocol in comments
- Regular audits of generated code to ensure compliance

---

**CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:** Any AI assistant working on this project must explicitly acknowledge understanding and acceptance of this safety protocol before proceeding with any Metabase-related tasks.
