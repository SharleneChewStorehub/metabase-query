## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### 🎯 Immediate Actions Required

1. **Improve Specificity Training**
   - **Current**: 2.62/5.00 average specificity
   - **Target**: >4.0/5.00
   - **Action**: Train AI to extract specific entity names from report titles
   - **Focus**: Business-specific terminology rather than generic descriptions

2. **Enhance Filter Detection**
   - **Current**: 65.4% miss key business levers
   - **Target**: <20% missing key levers
   - **Action**: Implement better SQL WHERE clause analysis
   - **Focus**: Business-critical filters (status, type, category)

3. **Maintain Business Focus** ✅
   - **Current**: 4.04/5.00 (Strong performance)
   - **Action**: Continue emphasizing business context over technical implementation

### 🚀 Long-term Improvements

1. **Quality Threshold Implementation**
   - Set minimum specificity score of 3 for production summaries
   - Flag reports with "No" key lever identification for review

2. **Training Data Enhancement**
   - Use 96 "Good" quality examples as training templates
   - Focus training on the 375 poor-quality patterns identified

3. **Automated Quality Gates**
   - Implement real-time assessment before summary publication
   - Alert when specificity drops below threshold
